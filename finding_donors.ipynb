    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision trees are a supervised learning method that utilizes a tree structure for decision making.\n",
    "Decision trees are widely used in various fields. For example, it can be used in recommendation applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths[1]:\n",
    "- easy to understand, interpret, and visualize.\n",
    "- Decision trees implicitly perform feature selection.\n",
    "- Can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- Decision trees require relatively little data preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses[1]:\n",
    "- Decision trees can overfit by creating complex trees which do not generalize well.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being    generated. This is called variance, which needs to be lowered by methods like bagging and boosting.\n",
    "- Greedy algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the data set prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are great for classification problems in general and don't require lots of preprocessing even though we've done some. Although they are prone to overfitting, the model can be improved by doing some tunning.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost works by creating weak learners where each one tries to classify the data based on the classification of the previous learners and how they weighed the misclassified points, and to finally form a final model by combining all the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is great for solving classification problems in general. A real-world example for Adaboost is predicting customers churn[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths[2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaboost can be used with different classifers as weak learners.\n",
    "- AdaBoost has a high degree of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training can be time consuming[2].\n",
    "- AdaBoost is extremely sensitive to noisy data and outliers[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost uses Decision trees as weak learners by default, so it's a good idea to choose Adaboost as a candidate classifier to see how good it does in comparison to Decision trees since it solves overfitting by lowering the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is commonly used in classification problems especially in binary classification problems. They can be used in classification problems in general, such as, image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths[4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the simplest machine learning algorithms yet provides great efficiency.\n",
    "- Variance is low.\n",
    "- It can also used for feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses[4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doesn’t handle large number of categorical variables well.\n",
    "- It requires transformation of non-linear features.\n",
    "- They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",

    "The final model selected is **Adaboost** which is an ensemble method used for supervised learning. The model works by creating weak learners from other classifiers, such as, Decision Trees. The model starts with the first learner to classify the data and apply equal weights to all points. The second learner evaluates the previous model by increasing the misclassified points' weight by a factor. Then the third learner performs the same task on the second model and so on for the other weak learners. After that, the all models are combined to generate the final model. So, the model is trained by classifying the individuals in the census data on whether their income is up to or higher than 50K based on the features in the data , such as, Age, capital-gain, etc. Then, we can make predictions using the trained model to predict whether a person's income is up to or higher than 50K using the individual's information."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
